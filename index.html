    <h3> The CSS tags</h3>
    <p> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. which is a language to design our website. For example the colors and features of our website can be designed through this language. 
      <b> Selectors</b> is a term which we use to select a specific element  or part of our website to be styled and designed. After selecting a particular part of the website we need to follow the rule to be able to make our
      the change we are aiming for. This change will be happened through a rule which has a <b> property</b> and <b>value</b>. So he example belowe shows a simple use of CSS. 
    </p>
    <p><html> <head> <title> Practice of CSS</title> <b> <style> h1 { Property:Value; }</style></b></B></b></head></html></p>. 
    <b> Colors: </b> In CSS we can change the colors of different elements through 3 different ways: 
    <ol> <li> Names</li> <li> RGB </li> <li> HEX codes</li></ol>
    <ul> <li> <b> Names:</b></li> We can write down names of different colors and make our style, however, sometimes there are colors that we don't know the names of them therefore 
      we are using different methods which make us to use many mixed colors to design our elements. 
      <li> <strong>RGB:</strong>  </li>which stands for RED, GREEN, BLUE. These three colors are the main colors in natural world which with the combination of them we can a variety of colors. To use this method in our website what we do is that we write rgb(123456) after our selector. 
      Each two number shows the solidity of each color and results different colors. 
    </ul>
